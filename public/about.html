<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm <b>Thierry Mekontso.</b> I have over a year of experience as a software
  engineer with Revature. I've already completed many projects and assisted 
  with updating two other projects for two small businesses.
</p>

<p>Prior to this role, I was in the Cybersecurity field where I spent over three years
  learning many topics from network design and security management, system security, switches, firewall,
  and servers management. My passion for writing code in Python first (very first language 
  I've learn in my cybersecurity class) led me to definitely pivoting towards the fiels of software engineering.
</p>

<p>I'm confifdent that by combining my cybersecurity skills with my software engineering
  would set a little bit in a better seat in today's job market full of employees with
  different backgrounds. My goal now is to continue learning, improving my curring skills, and in the next few years, being 
  able to train or lead a team of developers, giving my own opinion that could positively impact the 
  organization I'm working for.
