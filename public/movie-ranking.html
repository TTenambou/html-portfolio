<h1>The Best Movies According to Thierry</h1>
<h2>Here are my top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</h3>
<p>This is one of those old movies that remains very popular even 50 years after it was released.
<h3>Micheal Nike</h3>
<p>This was my passtime movie when I was young. The movie is about a man and its super car coonected to its smart watch.
This sounds like normal in 2024, but in 1999 when I was watching this movie, "it was not possible", we said.</p>
<h3>24 Hours Chrono</h3>
<p>This is an amazing American action movie that went viral once it was released.
The movie is everything about terrorism, showing America is hate by so many terrorist organizations around the world.</p>
